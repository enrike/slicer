@to do

** important issues to fix asap **
situation does not save/load muted layers. does it do num of layers?. 
toogle node automovement does not work. it should be independent from node movement speed variable
Frame does not display the right size! menu eats part of the canvas. different behaviours in different versions of wx?
**

allow to set layer colors in prefs file? and num of layers? (save colors to help recognise layers. maybe not if set on prefs)

control per pixel con flechas teclado
lock H/V with keys hold

nodes wrap vs bounce?

is there a limit to node speed?

save node positions to a bank of situations controled from a panel. independent from sessions? to be able to switch between "snapshots"

"drag" on demand vertical guides to mark hotspost on specific positions in the sound timeline

* keyboard
numeros 1/8 mute layers 0 -7?

"solo" control for each node? mutes others but me

control M -> mute/unmute o solo M sin control?

* control nodes :
jump to point when selected
move even when clicked / right click to force not move
automovement? / short periodic jumps within a range

save spew and debug msgs to a log file?




















Slicer TO DO :

stop individual nodes movement
boost individual node volume
(node control menu/panel: to control individual node parameters)
loop crossing control. supercollider
# change node direction ?
# panel tendencia de movimiento de boxes-> x+xdelta+generalXtendency
# bounce/wrap box movement
click dest point and asign it to box (like in SIDIC)
flock behaviour add with pannel to control strenghts
hold playhead
reset > make it work
reset to mouse locH?

# - integrate with ixiQuarks. Set Busses out and sound pools
- draw wave on graph display - ask tom # enable/disable on menus
# - block horizontal or vertical movement of handles when dragged by holding h or v key.
- shift changes visualization mode (zooms into some particular shape or shows some other type of info that was otherwise invisible for any reason like being distracting)

- record path of boxes
- move selected boxes with arrow keys and shift / GAMEPAD
- display shift/st point etc.. in millisecs
- freeze sound loop like with old app
- some one parameter effect for individual layers that can be controlled from the ring
- volume is not properly set. dont need to divide amp by numOfLayers
- envelope in the display?


panel / menus:
- snap to 1 pitch
- layers max lenght (startpoint=0, lenght=max, shift=0)
- plot wave out on panel like PD table
- plot sound output spectrum
- wxpannel with output general effects or filters (dist, delay, tremolo, lbp,hp, eq...)
# - On/Off microtones, audio, pitch, pan, amplitude slider * its all already on the menus, do i need this?
- snd pool menu error after adding new snd
# - snd pool add snd folder
- gamepad mapping configuration panel
- fixed color gradient for display?
- something like Toms externals to select which part from the sound goes into the app?


sc to do:
- list on jack
- remove loop clicks
rec to disk
rec to buffer / save in disk?
send lenght / loop via osc
effects


wx to do :
drag n drop on window?


mirra to do:
setMouseVisible in wxpython
