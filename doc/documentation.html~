<p class="titles"> <a name="description"></a>Description:</p>

<p> Slicer allows you to create rhythms and textures from any sound you import 
  by moving the Slicer nodes. Slicer will chop your sound into slices and superpose 
  them. The slices will be created and manipulated acording to the position of 
  the control nodes (the ones represented by a square). The slicer nodes (in color) 
  control volume (vertical) and pan(horizontal) of each slice, while the control 
  nodes control pitch, lenght, shift and starting point for all the slices.</p>
<p>A Slicer demo video is available at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxvii1A3a-g" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxvii1A3a-g</a></p>
<p>Slicer has been constructed using Mirra, a Python 2D OpenGL graphics library 
  developed by ixi. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://ixi-software.net/mirra" target="_blank">http://ixi-audio.net/mirra</a>. 
  Find more detailed info on Mirra check <a href="http://ixi-software.net/content/download/mirra/documentation.html" target="_blank">http://ixi-audio.net/content/download/mirra/documentation.html</a>

Slicer contains parts and libraries by others such as 
<a href="http://ixi-software.net/mirra" target="_blank">Mirra</a> (LGPL), 
<a href="http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/6" target="_blank">SuperCollider</a>, 
<a href="http://www.patrickkidd.com/pk/trac/wiki/SuperCollider" target="_blank">scosc / scsynth</a>,

<a href="http://pygame.org" target="_blank">pygame</a> (GPL), 
<a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">pyopengl</a> (BSD), and 
<a href="http://wxpython.org" target="_blank">wxpython</a> (wxWindows Library Licence).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="titles"><a name="system" id="system"></a>System requirements:</p>
<p> Slicer works under any platform where Python and SCsynth runs. This means 
  : OS X, Windows, GNU/Linux.<br>
  The development has been done under GNU/Linux and even we test it under windows 
  and OSX we encourage you to report problems you might encounter under windows 
  and OSX. We test our apps in all platforms but probably not as in depth as you 
  when you are using them!. 
<p>Slicer should run ok on a 1100mhz PIII laptop with 258 RAM and 16M graphics 
  card both under XP and GNU/Linux, but you might want to use a better graphics 
  card for less CPU load. 
<p>If you run Slicer from the python source you need the following dependencies<br>
  <a href="http://python.org" target="_blank">python</a>, <a href="http://ixi-software.net/mirra" target="_blank">mirra</a>, 
  <a href="http://pygame.org" target="_blank">pygame</a>, <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">pyopengl</a>, 
  <a href="http://wxpython.org" target="_blank">wxpython</a>, and <a href="http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/6" target="_blank">SuperCollider</a>.</p>
<p>* <strong>Note For Windows users </strong>: Under some versions of Windows 
  you might need to install as well GLUT32.dll to get OpenGL graphics running. 
  This can be downloaded from http://www.xmission.com/%7Enate/glut.html . Just 
  copy the glut32.dll into your c:\windows\system32 folder and it should work.</p>
<p><b>* Note on firewalls </b>: Some firewalls like ZoneAlarm or the Windows XP 
  firewall in some cases might try to block Slicer, this is because the graphics 
  engine and the sound engine comunicate via internal network. Dont be afraid 
  this is totally normal, in those cases you just need to grant permissions to 
  Slicer (and maybe to scsynth, the sound engine). </p>

<p class="titles"><a name="instalation" id="instalation"></a>Installation
</p>

<p>- OSX : Uncompress the zip, move the Slicer to any directory in your machine 
  and just run it. <br>
  - Windows : Uncompress the zip, run vccrt.msi file once ( * this is important!! 
  * ), move the Slicer to any directory in your machine and just run it.<br>
  - GNU/Linux : install dependencies and run &quot;python slicer.py&quot; command.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="titles"><a name="tutorial" id="tutorial"></a>Short tutorial / how to:</p>
Note that this is a quick description of the Slicer's features, you are welcome to write something more in depth and sent it to us to include
here!

<p> - Controls : <br>
  Vertical and horizontal position of control nodes (the two bigger squares) change 
  pitch, start point, slice length and start point shift.<br>
  Slice boxes (in color, surrounded by a circle) control pan and amplitude for 
  each of the slices.<br>
  Layers (in the background) show the chuck of the original sound that each slice 
  is playing. Layers and slice boxes are associated, Layer number 0 and slice 
  box number 0 represent sound slice number 0, they have same color and are labeled 
  with the same number. Mute/unmute each slice by right clicking on the slice 
  box or in the layer associated to it. If mute the slice box will be labeled 
  as 'Muted' and its Layer display will fade away. The numbers in the left side 
  of the layers display the start and end point of its sound slice, this is currently 
  display as numbers ranging 0 to 1. Soon it will be displayed in milliseconds. 
  We will also draw the shape of the sound in each layer. <br>
  <br>
  - Sounds :<br>
  Slicer will automatically try to load all sounds in the "sounds" folder at start 
  up into the sound pool. This means that they are loaded in RAM and accesible 
  for use. You can add more sounds or folders with sounds from the sound pool 
  menu. <br>
  - Preferences :<br>
  There is a file called prefs.txt next to the application where you can change 
  your startup preferences. BEWARE that if you break the file formating this might 
  not be read properly by Slicer. 
<p>- Menu File &gt; Save / Open sessions :<br>
  Slicer allows now to save/open sessions. A session is just a text file that 
  saves the details of the system in a specific moment . By opening old files 
  we can go back to previous situations. To make sure the sounds are found copy 
  them to /sounds folder before importing them into Slicer.<br>
  <br>
  - Pitch control panel :<br>
  This panel allows to set the top, central and bottom values for the pitch range. 
  It allows to choose which pitch range we want to work with in Slicer. You MUST 
  press the update values button for the new values to de updated. Setting Microtones 
  option off will force the pitch transformation to be in tone steps. <br>
  <br>
  - Auto menu : Box auto movement pannel allow to set the speed of the box movement. 
  This will change pan and volume for each slicer acording to the wandering of 
  the boxes With node auto movement on, control nodes will do small jumps randomly. 
  To stop them set speed to zero. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="titles"><a name="todo" id="todo"></a>TO DO:
</p>

<p> <br>
  - integrate with ixiQuarks. Set Busses out and sound pools<br>

  - loop crossing control. in supercollider<br>
  - bounce/wrap box movement on window limits<br>
  - click dest point and asign it to box<br>
  - flock behaviour add with pannel to control strenghts<br>
  - hold playhead<br>
  - reset > make it work properly<br>
  - reset to mouse locH?<br>

  - Some Windows users report that the mouse click point is few pixels above the actual position of the mouse, <br>
  dragging the squares is almost impossible when this happens.<br>
  - nodes jump back to prev position after dragged with mod key pressed<br>
  - half a tone steps when microtones is off<br>
  - draw wave on graph display -> enable/disable on menus<br>
  - record path of boxes<br>
  - move selected boxes with arrow keys and shift and from GAMEPAD<br>
  - display shift/st point etc.. in millisecs<br>
  - freeze sound loop like with old app<br>
  - one parameter effect for individual layers that can be controlled from the ring<br>
  - envelope in the display?<br>
  - grid showing pitch add 1, -1 lines to display<br>
  <br>
  panel / menus:<br>
  - help menu opens documentation on browser <br>
  - plot wave out on panel like PD table<br>
  - plot sound output spectrum<br>
  - wxpannel with output general effects or filters (dist, delay, tremolo, lbp,hp, 
  eq...)<br>
  - On/Off microtones, audio, pitch, pan, amplitude slider * its all already on 
  the menus, not sure if it is useful to have it here as well<br>
  - out equalicer ?<br>
  - gamepad mapping configuration panel<br>
  # - file menu open/save/saveas to save configuration<br>
  - fixed color gradient for display?<br>
  - something like PD's wvvw external to select which part from the sound goes 
  into the app?<br>
  <br>
  scsynth to do:<br>
  loop crossing clicks remove<br>
  reset/synch to mouse playheads<br>
  rec to disk<br>
  rec to buffer / save in disk?<br>
  send length via osc<br>
  effects<br>
  <br>
  wx to do :<br>
  drag n drop on window?<br>
  <br>
  mirra to do:<br>
  setMouseVisible in wxpython<br>

<p> Thanks to Goto10 collective <a href="http://www.goto10.org" target="_blank">www.goto10.org</a> 
  for thir SVN hosting and mailing list.</p>

<p>Some parts of the development of and Slicer Mirra were developed with the support 
  from different institutions :<br>
  - The Digital Research Unit at the University of Huddersfield. <a href="http://druh.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.druh.co.uk</a><br>
  - The Lansdown Center for Electronic Arts at Middlesex University who helped 
  providing expertise and support for developing the early versions of Mirra. 
  <a href="http://www.cea.mdx.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.cea.mdx.ac.uk/</a><br>
  - Bizkaiko Diputazioa, Basque Country.<br>
  - Buchsenhausen Kunstlerhaus, Innsbruck, Austria.</p>
<p>thanks to patrick, tom schoulten and tom betts for the technical help. </p>
<br>

<p class="titles"><a name="feedback" id="feedback"></a>Troubleshooting : </p>
<p> &quot;I get no sound&quot; :<br>
- Windows users : have you already run the vccrt.msi file? This installs some components needed by the sound engine.<br>
  - try re-running the application, sometimes it does not intialise the sound 
  engine properly, we are working on this.<br>
  - make sure that scsynth process is not already running in your machine before 
  you run slicer.<br>
  - if you have a firewall running you might need to give permissions to scsynth 
  and slicer to use port 55170.<br>
  - your sound is not stereo (yeah... we know... it is in the to do list).</p>
<p>&quot;I get clicks sometimes&quot; :<br>
  some sounds click when crossing the loop point, this is in the to do list ... 
  please be patient. If you have time and code in Supercollider maybe you can 
  help?</p>
<p>Using Slicer with Jack, Hijack, SoundFlower ... :<br>
  Slicer sound engine will appear named as Supercollider or SCsynth in those programs.</p>
<p> Any other kind of errors :<br>
  Under windows and mac in case of errors the application leaves a log file called 
  &quot;slicer.log&quot; or &quot;slicer.exe.log where the errors are described, 
  copy the text and send it to us in an email. Please include as much info as 
  possible about the error and your system (OS version, soundcard, processor speed), 
  we will try to help. On Linux just copy the error from the console.</p>
